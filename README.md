Created a tool that estimates data science salaries (MAE ~ $ 11K) to help data scientists negotiate their income when they get a job.
Scraped over 1000 job descriptions from glassdoor using python and selenium
Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws, and spark.
Optimized Linear, Lasso, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.
Built a client facing API using flask

* **Python libraries used:** pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, selenium, flask, json, pickle
